# **College Connect**

College Connect is an android application aimed to be a one-stop-shop for all the college needs irrespective of college and course.  
It aims to create a helpful platform for all college students.
It uses Firebase and SQLite to store and display the information to the user.
The app uses Material UI for an attractive interface (subject to improvement) which attracts the user to stay on the app for more time.


The app is developed using native android(Java and Kotlin both) and follows MVVM architecture. It is tightly coupled as it was developed as a project to learn Android Development.
